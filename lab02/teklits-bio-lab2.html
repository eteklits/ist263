        <h1>Lainey's Biography</h1>
        <p> Hi, my name is Elaina Teklits and I am a senior studying Information Management and Technology. Through this major, I hope to become a business analyst for a marketing department at a retail company one day. A few skills I have include a beginner understanding of Python, proficiency in Excel and PowerPoint, and practice using data visualization tools, such as Power BI. One big accomplishment of mine is that I got to intern at <strong>Wayfair</strong> this summer in business analytics. This was one of my dream internships as I love Boston and have always wanted to work for a big, technology focused retail company. </p>
