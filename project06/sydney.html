    <p><strong>Bondi:</strong> Sydney’s main/most popular beach that I absolutely fell in love with. The perfect beach to grab a bite at, shop, or hit the surf!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Raw Bar: A great Sushi place in North Bondi. It gets really crowded so you definitely want to go at an off time or get takeout. </li>
        <li>Orchard Street: A completely vegan and gf coffee shop in North Bondi. Absolutely loved this place. </li>
        <li>Anita: A good gelato place. They have them all over Sydney so avoid the Bondi one if at all possible because it is so crowded.</li>
        <li>Health Emporium:  A health grocery store with the absolute BEST JUICES in Sydney.  </li>
        <li>Char Rotisserie: A healthy to-go restaurant on Bondi Road. Good place to stop on your way back from the beach and get dinner.</li>

    <p><strong>CBD (Central Business District):</strong> Downtown Sydney</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pancakes on The Rocks: Late night pancake place by the Sydney Opera House. So fun to go to for late night food.</li>
        <li>Uncle Ming’s Bar: One of my favorite restaurants in Sydney! They only serves dumplings but they were the best dumplings I have ever had. </li>
        <li>Ms. Gs: We went here with our parents in Kings Cross. The vibe of the restaurant is so cool, and they play fun music. </li>
        <li>Spice Alley: A long hidden alley outside of Surry Hills with a huge range of Asian food vendors all in the same spot. The vibes here are so cool and fun. </li>

    <p><strong>Bondi Junction:</strong> Bondi Junction connects the beaches, like Bondi beach, to downtown Sydney. The main public transportation hub is here right next to the mall.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hudson’s Bakery: An entirely gluten free bakery!! They have bagels, muffins, pizza, sandwiches, crisps, banana bread, etc. </li>
        <li>Ruby’s Diner: Just an easy and good basic brunch.</li>

    <p><strong>Coogee: </strong>A pretty beach down the coast from Bondi. This is a popular beach for UNSW students to go to. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coogee Beach Hotel: A mix between a dinner spot and an outside bar. I would recommend going for drinks and then heading outside to the bar. </li>
        <li>Melon Head: This was my favorite acai bowl in Sydney!</li>
        <li>Maloneys Grocer: Specialty/health grocery store right up the road from Coogee.</li>

    <p><strong>Tamarama:</strong> This was probably my favorite beach in Sydney. It is basically a smaller, less crowded, and prettier quaint beach in between Bondi and Bronte. Surfers, good vibes, and it is usually empty. Go! </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The cafe behind the beach is also really good. Get an acai bowl and a smoothie/juice.</li>

    <p><strong>Bronte: </strong>A beautiful beach town that is one beach down from Tamarama Beach.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Iggy’s Bakery: one of the best bakeries in Sydney. Right up the street from Bronte beach. Great sourdough, croissants, and most importantly AMAZING BAGELS.  Most brunch places use this place's bread so that tells you how good it is. </li>
        <li>Orchard Street: Same place as in Bondi, just a smaller version.</li>

    <p><strong>Paddington: </strong>A quiant suburb of Sydney's CBD. Amazing restaurants and small boutiques.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fred’s: An amazing farm to table restaurant in Sydney. It is on Oxford St in Paddington. We went with our parents and did a set menu for 9 and you practically get to eat in the kitchen which is so cool. Also, make a reservation early because it is hard to get a table.</li>
        <li>The Paddington: Same owner as Fred’s. Has a more relaxed feel than Fred’s but still a nice restaurant with great food. Really good rotisserie chicken with a fun vibe.</li>
        <li>Brigade Bar: A 5 floor bar with a rooftop on the top floor. Live sport, good drinks, and is very spacious. Good place to go before a rugby or AFL game.</li>

    <p><strong>Surry Hills: </strong>If you are into coffee and cafes, come to Surry Hills. There are amazing coffee shops and cafes on every street corner. We did a self-guided coffee tour and it was so fun.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paramount Coffee Project: A good brunch spot/coffee. Make sure to get the avocado toast and a latte. Also, this is a great place to sit and get work done.</li>
        <li>Bills- Most perfect brunch spot. We went to the one in Surry Hills and in Darlinghurst, but they are all over the city. Aesthetically pleasing and amazing food. </li>
        <li>Dead Ringer: Probably my favorite restaurant in Sydney. The food is amazing, and the vibes are immaculate. A perfect place to take parents because it is sort of on the pricier side. </li>
