    <h3>Tasmania</h3>
    <p class="tinyparagraph">An island south of Australia with beautiful national parks, good farmers markets, and a lot of boating/sailing. A great place to hike and be outside in nature. </p>
    <img src="../Project04/Tasmania.jpg" width="270"  alt="Landscape in Tasmania, Australia">

    <p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Mac Q01 Hotel</p>
    <p><strong>Favorites Activities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hobart Twilight Markets:  Friday night market in the park. Good range of food vendors and live music! </li>
        <li>Salamanca Markets: Saturday morning market in the park. Great mix of food and local vendors (jewelry, prints, souvenirs, etc) </li>
        <li> <a href= "https://www.bonorong.com.au/" target= "blank">Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary</a>- Tasmanian Devils!</li>
        <li> <a href= "https://brunyislandsafari.rezdy.com/116363/bruny-island-safaris-foods-sightseeing-and-lighthouse-tour" target="_blank" >Bruny Island Tour:</a> We did a full day Bruny Island tour that included both food and sightseeing. We absolutely loved the one we did and found it to be an ideal way to see the whole the island. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Favorite Restaurants:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href= "https://urbangreek.com.au/" target="blank">Urban Greek:</a> A Greek restaurant up the hill from the pier. The food is definitely good but it is a lot of food so make sure you go really hungry.</li>
    <li>Bar Wa Izakaya: Japanese Tapas. Such a cool fun/quirky vibe with a great menu. The drinks were different but really good and it was just a happy place that I would definitely recommend going to. Make a reservation!</li>
    <li>Van Diemen's Land Creamery, Hobart: Quite possibly the best ice cream I have ever had. Go and get the salted caramel.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <div class="column5">
    <h3>Byron Bay</h3>
    <p class="tinyparagraph2">The most perfect place ever. Bryon Bay is a small beach town up the coast from Sydney. I would have gone here every weekend abroad if I could have!</p>
    <br>
    <img src ="../Project04/byronbay.jpg" width="270" alt="Beach in Byron Bay, Australia">
    <img src ="../Project04/byron2.jpg" width="285" alt="Beach in Byron Bay, Australia">
    <p><strong>Flight:</strong> Jetstar from Sydney to Ballina Airport (Byron Bay) 1 ½ hrs </p>
    <p><strong>Accommodation: </strong>Julian’s Apartments / Luxurious: Elements of Byron / Raes is also very popular.</p>
   
    <p> <strong>Favorite Activities: </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lighthouse walk: A must. This walk is quite challenging though so be prepared for a full-on hike. This hike would be so pretty at sunrise or sunset.</li>
        <li>Kellin Falls- A beautiful waterfall 20 minutes from downtown Byron Bay. We rented a car to drive here and then went to the farm. </li>
        <li>Surf lessons: If you surf or have ever wanted to try surfing, this is the place to try!</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Favorite Restaurants:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Mez Club: Mediterranean tapas downtown! There is a limited menu but everything we tried was so good! You need a reservation!</li>
        <li>Bayleaf and Combi: are both must-go to brunch places. The food is insane and they are right downtown.  </li>
        <li>The Balcony Bar & Oyster Co: We didn’t end up making to this restaurant but heard it is a great place!</li>
        <li>The Farm: A great place to spend a morning or afternoon. This place helps to break up a bunch of beach days in a row. </li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>Thailand</h3>
    <p class="tinyparagraph3">Thailand is such a beautiful and culturally diverse country. You definitely want to spend at least one full week traveling there. The most popular places that tourists visit are Bangkok, Koh Samui, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Phi Phi Islands. You can’t really go wrong with any of them, it just depends on what you want out of the vacation. </p>

    <p><strong>Flight:</strong> Air Asia from Sydney to Bangkok (10 hr flight)</p>
    <p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> JW Marriott </p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Activities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We did a half day boat tour around Samui where we went to a pig island, went “snorkeling” (but it was a cloudy day and even the reviews from the past say you don’t really see fish — we mainly went for pig island / the tour), we ate lunch on Koh Tan (a small island off of Samui), then ended by driving around the 5 little islands. We used <a href= "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1179396-d8762270-Reviews-Happy_Samui_Tours-Bophut_Ko_Samui_Surat_Thani_Province.html" target="_blank" >Happy Samui</a> for the tour (they are on TripAdvisor but we found them through our hotel)</li>
        <li><a href= "https://thaifarmcooking.net/#.Y9zI9-QxW_Y" target="_blank" >Thai Farm Cooking School</a> (Chiang Mai) A must, especially if you like Thai food. Probably my favorite thing we did in Thailand. You get to go to the market then to their farm where you cook and prepare all of the food yourself!</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Favorite Restaurants:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tawann (Koh Samui): A traditional Thai restaurant run by the hotel. It had pretty good pad Thai and stir fry but you can get the same if not better quality Thai food from the locals just down the road (a LOT cheaper too)</li>
        <li>Katz Kitchen (Chiang Mai): Really good and authentic Thai food. It was super cheap and packed with people so we stopped for lunch and it was really good. </li>
        <li>Ginger & Kafe Restaurant (Chiang Mai): We came here for dinner and it was great! Super cool /pretty interior design all over the restaurant and the food was great Thai food with American food options too.  </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h3>New Zealand</h3>
    <p class="tinyparagraph4">The most magical place on earth. If you have any desire at all to ever wander around in a camper van and move from spot to spot, this is the place to do it. One big recommendation I have is to prioritize seeing the South Island over the North Island!<p>

    <p><strong>Flight: </strong>JetStar from Sydney International Airport into Queenstown.</p>
    <p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Hostels / airbnbs</p>
    <p><strong>Favorite Activities:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed boat in Skippers Canyon ($119 NZ Dollars): Worth it. Driving there was amazing and the boat was so cool. You zip through this amazing canyon.  </li>
        <li>Queenstown trail: A much easier/primarily flat walk that goes around Lake Wakatipu. Beautiful views and accessible right from town.</li>
        <li>Milford Sound: So called “8th wonder of the world”. Around a four hr drive from Queenstown that is very scenic but definitely long. I would definitely drive or helicopter there instead of doing a tour bus. The Milford Sound itself was actually magical. We did a 2 hr boat cruise along the river and it was stunning.</li>
        <li>Wanaka Lavender Farm: Beautiful farm with a cute shop and cafe that does honey tastings. It is about 10 minutes outside of Wanaka. It's in season around December- March so that is definitely the best time to go but we went in the off season and it was still fun. (They also have an alpaca :)</li>
       
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Favorite Restaurants:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arthurs: Easy sandwiches and wraps that are actually really good.</li>
        <li>Fergburger: Hands down the best burger I have ever had. Go, go, go. (You might want to order online or go at an off hour because it gets so crowded. The bar, ice cream place and bakery are also amazing.)</li>
        <li>Bespoke Kitchen: Another great breakfast place that is owned by the same owners of Vudu. Above town but a nice cozy place for breakfast or lunch (kitchen closes at 2 pm. We made that mistake lol) </li>

    </ul>
